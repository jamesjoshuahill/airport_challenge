Tech Test Submission Requirements/Guidelines
======

Before submitting your test, please review the requirements/guidelines below. Note that the requirements are mandatory and if you do not satisfy them we won't review your code (we don't mean to be harsh but this is based on the minimum expectations that our hiring partners require when you submit code for tech tests).

Requirements
------

* Make sure you have written your own README that briefly explains your approach to solving the challenge.
* If your code isn't finished it's not ideal but acceptable as long as you explain in your README where you got to and how you would plan to finish the challenge.
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README.
* Ensure all your tests are passing.
* All code must be written test-first - we're looking for 100% [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) or as near as possible to that figure.
  * The test coverage statistics `SimpleCov` generates after your tests will show you what your coverage is like and where it's lacking.
* Elegant code: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
* Check your code conforms to the [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) style guide. Run `rubocop`, read and digest what it says, fix the violations and then run `rubocop` again to check. When you're done, commit and push.
  * Advanced mode: run `rubocop` before every commit you make and fix mistakes before you even commit!

Guidelines
-------

* Ensure you've understood the specification and built the code according to the challenge guidelines.
* Read through [Code Reviews&nbsp;:pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/code_reviews.md) to understand what we're looking for in your code.

Review
------

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md). Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier. You should be the judge of how much challenge you want today.
